<h2>Welcome to flash games reborn!</h2>

    Our vision is to recreate an old space scroller and<br>
    shooter-esque game! We will be achieving this by utilizing<br>
    the P5.js repository, that allows for the creation of<br>
    onscreen visuals using a canvas. This allows for a multitude<br>
    of uses, but in our case we will be creating a game!<br><br>

    The idea came from the depracation of software such as<br>
    Adobe Flash Player, which means that many flash games<br>
    that we know and love will no longer be playable unless<br>
    they are ported over to other engines. But we have an idea<br><br>

    We will use P5.js to create a memento, to a time when being<br>
    able to play and compete with friends online was as simple<br>
    as coming home, launching a web browser, pasting a link,<br>
    and getting competitive!

<h4>We hope you enjoy our playing and<br>competing as much as we did creating!</h4>
