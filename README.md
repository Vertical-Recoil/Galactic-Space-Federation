# Galactic-Space-Federation
CompSci Capstone Course Project:

<h2>Welcome to flash games reborn!</h2>

    Our vision is to recreate an old space scroller and
    shooter-esque game! We will be achieving this by utilizing
    the P5.js repository, that allows for the creation of
    onscreen visuals using a canvas. This allows for a multitude
    of uses, but in our case we will be creating a game!

    The idea came from the depracation of software such as
    Adobe Flash Player, which means that many flash games
    that we know and love will no longer be playable unless
    they are ported over to other engines. But we have an idea

    We will use P5.js to create a memento, to a time when being
    able to play and compete with friends online was as simple
    as coming home, launching a web browser, pasting a link,
    and getting competitive!

<h4>We hope you enjoy our playing and<br>competing as much as we did creating!</h4>

# ChangeLog (FULL)
    v1.5.0: Added the Chronosphere enemy debuff which
    will slow down the enemy and their lasers. Let's
    go full Neo mode!

    v1.4.0: Major Update, added 2 new enemy types
    the sub-boss and the boss. Sub-boss has 1 health
    just like the rest of the enemies but has a blue
    laser that can slow down the player if the player
    gets damaged by it. Also added a Boss to the game
    which will have more health than the standard
    enemy and will harass the player by staying at a
    firing distance away from the player.

    v1.3.0: Added EMP bomb or enemy debuff into the
    game. Getting this will disable all enemy weapons
    modules and cause all lasers expect the players to
    disappear off the screen.

    v1.2.4: Added MultiShot upgrade/buff for the player
    into the game. This will add two more lasers to the
    top and bottom of the players laser to increase hit
    chance of the player.

    v1.2.2: Fixed visual error with the invuln and
    quickshot upgrade squares.

    v1.2.1: Added QuickBullet upgrade/buff for the player
    into the game. QuickBullet does what it sounds like,
    it will increase the speed of the laser that the player
    is firing.

    v1.1.1: Previous version + a profanity filter...
    Because people like to think that they are funny!

    v1.1.0: Previous version + database connection via
    firestore database! We can now store the users name
    into a variable and pass it along so that when the
    game finally ends, it will send the name and the score
    to the database, and from the database to our leaderboard.

    v1.0.2: Previous version + Player buffs, including
    invulnerability, a ship representation of the buff,
    as well as a timer on the bottom left to indicate the
    time left of the power-up! Also added visuals to show
    the players current difficulty level in the top right.

    v1.0.1: Previous version + Difficulty factor, including
    more and quicker enemies based on your current score.
    Replaced the royalty free music with made by the devs.

    v1.0.0: Base version of the game, no difficulty scale,
    no upgrades, only you, your enemies, a healthpack, and
    some shoddy music to keep the gloom of space away.
